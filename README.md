## What is the Problem?
Jobs in government sector are emerging at a very rapid rate. A lot of innovative minds are working hard to get a job in govt. sector. 
But apart from this a big disadvantage of these governement tests are that the **identity of the person is not fully secured**. 
It is difficult to recognise or identify whether the same person is appearing in the test or not. 
Many Govt tests rely on the forms with blurred image of that person for the identification.
Many times the person appearing for the paper is not the one who has applied for the test. 
This is what our Education System lacks  and this the area what we have to work hard according to us.
Identity of a person is most important. A simple blurred photo on a form is not able to recognise the identity of a person whether it is an online or offline test.
so in order to decrease this risk, we are trying our best to implement this idea. We hope we can bring a change to the education system and to the society.

## How we are Trying to Solve This?
This problem can be solved by making the person sign up for our site for filling any kind of govt online test. 
The person filling up the form has to go through several steps, first he/she has  to signup for our site, then the person will be directed towards the face recognition test.
Face Recognisition test will capture the facial structure of the person and will save the data for further identification. After the Facial Recognisition form , person will be directed towards the typing test.
Typing Test will store the typing style and typing speed of a person and will match that pattern whenever the person will apply for online test.
Both these steps will again be reconsidered whenever the person login to our site.

## Technologies Used
We will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for the FrontEnd. For the BackEnd we'll use Flask(Python). Microsoft's Face API is used for
Facial Recogination and typingDNA is used for recording the Typing Pattern of the Users. SQLlite is used for the database.
